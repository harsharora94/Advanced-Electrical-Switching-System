# Advanced-Electrical-Switching-System
Advanced Electrical Switching System (AESS)

## Overview:
The proposed idea cropped up as a result of careful observation on wastage of electricity, in homes, offices and commercially in day to day life. Now we shall enter into our new proposed device which is designed by keeping in mind the basic concepts which shall drive the basics of the switching systems.

A sophisticated device is constructed, which will connect all the switches (e. g.-homes, etc.) of the place where power has to be saved from getting wasted. The installed device controls all the switches centrally, so that the switches of lights or any electrical equipment can be turned off or on automatically by the command, which we will set in the device.

A timer is programmed, which controls all the switches, so that the devices which has to be switched off, will be switched off at that particular time automatically. This system is also applicable to turn on the lights or electrical equipmentâ€™s if needed.
